# BachelorThesis

This repository contains all code for experiments used in my Bachelor's Thesis "VAEs with Learnable Priors for Learning a Robust Latent Space Representation of Single-Cell RNA Sequencing Data".

The implementation of the different priors in the SCVI model can be found here: https://github.com/LeanderDiazBone/scvi-tools
The installation and usage of this package works exactly like it's parent library scvi-tools, which can be found here: https://github.com/scverse/scvi-tools
